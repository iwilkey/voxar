## Getting Started

Voxar is based off of libGDX, a free and open-source game-development application framework. This means all the C and C++ dependencies are handled, and 
all GDX tools are readily available for use as well. The only concept you should familiarize yourself with is Gradle, the build system that handles Voxar
compilation, testing, distribution, and porting.
